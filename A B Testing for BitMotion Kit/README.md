A/B Testing Results Analysis for BitMotion Kit
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the results of an A/B test conducted for the BitMotion Kit online store, which specializes in gamified products for a healthy lifestyle. The goal of the analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new website version designed to improve user experience and increase conversion.
The Problem
The BitMotion Kit online store faced the issue of an overly complex user interface, as indicated by customer feedback. This complexity potentially hindered the attraction of new customers and reduced sales.
The Solution
To address this problem, a new version of the website was developed and tested on a portion of users through an A/B test. The core hypothesis was that the updated interface would significantly increase the number of users making a purchase.
My task involved conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the A/B test results.
Research Objectives
The project pursued the following research objectives:
	1	Data Assessment: Evaluate the sufficiency and adequacy of the provided data.
	2	Data Preprocessing: Clean the data of duplicates and identify users participating in the test.
	3	Compliance Check: Verify that the test execution adhered to the technical specification requirements.
	4	User Distribution: Check for uniform distribution of users across test groups.
	5	Overlap Absence: Ensure there are no overlaps with competing tests.
	6	Analysis Horizon: Determine an appropriate period for evaluating the results.
	7	Sample Size Assessment: Assess the sufficiency of the sample size to obtain statistically significant results.
	8	Metric Calculation: For each group, calculate the number of visitors who made a purchase, the total number of visitors, and the conversion rate.
	9	Statistical Analysis: Evaluate the change in conversion using an appropriate statistical test, considering all stages of hypothesis testing.
	10	Conclusions: Formulate conclusions based on the conducted A/B test results evaluation.
Data
Data on user actions and their distribution into groups, along with the technical specification, were provided for the analysis.
Conclusion
Based on the analysis, a conclusion will be drawn regarding the success or failure of the new website version in achieving the stated goals of increasing conversion, and recommendations for further actions will be provided.
A/B Test Evaluation Summary
The A/B test evaluation leads to the following conclusions:
	•	The hypothesis under investigation was confirmed; the expected effect was achieved.
	•	Simplifying the interface led to a statistically significant increase in the conversion of registered users into buyers within seven days of registration.
